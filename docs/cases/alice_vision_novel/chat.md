It seems there was an error with the image generation request due to the safety system. Let me adjust the prompt and try again.

```python

adjusted_prompt = 'Alice standing outside a house with a smiling cat in a tree, in a whimsical style, avoiding any potentially sensitive content.'
create_image(adjusted_prompt)
